<h3 align="left">Hi, I'm Yoshiki 👋🏼. </h3>
<ul align="left">
<li>I've been working professionally as a full stack Ruby on Rails engineer for 3 years now.</li>
<li>I'm currently freelancing for a startup in the hospitality industry on top of my full-time software job––both roles using a monolithic RoR stack. I'm a full-time Rubyist :)</li>
<li>My main gig uses Rails 4 and my freelance gig uses Rails 6. I am versed in both the old and new conventions of Rails.</li>
<li>I work well with minimal supervision while being extremely teachable.</li>
<li>I am an excellent communicator.</li>
<li>I can speak Japanese & English natively. Currently learning Mandarin Chinese.</li>
</ul>

Currently open to remote freelance/part-time opportunities where I can contribute around ~30 hours per month (negotiable).
