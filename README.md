<h3 align="left">Hi, I'm Yoshiki 👋🏼. </h3>
<p align="left">I'm a Software Engineer based in Tokyo. </p>
<p align="left">Ruby on Rails is what I mainly work with, but I don't mind a bit of React/Vue on occasion.

Currently open to freelance/part-time opportunities. <br>
So [send me a message](https://www.linkedin.com/in/yoshiki-bell/) if you need to hire a RoR developer! <br>
(needs to be full remote)
